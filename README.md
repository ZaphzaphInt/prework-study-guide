# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a short study guide that will help to recall some commands with various programming languages.
It enabled me to get into programming and have an introduction to it whilst helping to get others motivated to learn as well.
It also was a personal achievement for me as I felt that I couldn't code.
I learnt how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also I learnt how to use Git as an Agile project management platform.
